THERAPIST–PATIENT TRANSCRIPT (Sample 2)
Session Theme: Relationship conflict, communication, needs, repair
Format: Plain text dialogue (approx. 25 minutes)

Therapist: Welcome back. How have things been since we last met?
Client: Up and down. Mostly… tense.
Therapist: Tense with your partner?
Client: Yeah. We had another argument about the same thing—chores and “who does more.”
Therapist: The recurring loop: chores and fairness.
Client: Exactly. I feel like I’m carrying everything, and they act like I’m exaggerating.
Therapist: You feel unseen and unsupported.
Client: Yes. And then I get mad, and I say it in the worst way possible.
Therapist: What do you mean by “worst way”?
Client: I’ll bring up a list of everything they’ve done wrong over the last month. I become… like a prosecutor.
Therapist: So when you’re hurt, the way it comes out is through criticism and a long history.
Client: Yeah. And then they shut down and say, “Nothing I do is enough.” And we both feel awful.
Therapist: That sounds painful for both of you: you feel alone, they feel attacked.
Client: Exactly. I don’t want to attack them. I want them to show up.
Therapist: If we slow down, what’s the core need underneath the argument?
Client: I need partnership. I need to feel like we’re a team.
Therapist: Partnership and teamwork. When you don’t feel that, what story do you tell yourself?
Client: That they don’t care. Or that they’re selfish.
Therapist: And when you tell yourself “they don’t care,” what emotion shows up?
Client: Anger. And sadness. Like… I’m not important.
Therapist: Anger often protects sadness. If sadness could speak, what would it say?
Client: “Please notice me. Please help. I’m tired.”
Therapist: That’s very clear. Do you ever say that part out loud?
Client: Not really. It feels vulnerable.
Therapist: Vulnerable, yes. And also possibly more effective than the prosecutor approach. What happens when you try to be vulnerable?
Client: I’m scared they’ll dismiss it. Or I’ll look weak.
Therapist: So the criticism is a shield. It protects you from the risk of being dismissed.
Client: That’s true.
Therapist: Let’s map the cycle: Trigger happens—maybe you see dishes left out. Then thought: “They don’t care.” Emotion: sadness/anger. Behavior: criticism/prosecutor. Partner response: shutdown/defensive. Outcome: both feel worse. Does that fit?
Client: Yes, that’s exactly it.
Therapist: If we want to change the cycle, we can pick any point. Which part feels most changeable this week?
Client: Maybe… how I start the conversation.
Therapist: Great. The opening matters a lot. Can we practice a different opening right now?
Client: Okay.
Therapist: Imagine it’s the evening. You see the dishes. You feel the tension. Instead of listing everything, you try a “soft start.” Something like: “I’m feeling overwhelmed and I need help tonight. Can we do the kitchen together?” How does that sound?
Client: It sounds… nicer. But also like I’m begging.
Therapist: That’s an important feeling. If it feels like begging, what would make it feel like a team request instead?
Client: Maybe… “I need us to share this.” More “we.”
Therapist: Perfect. How about: “I’m feeling overwhelmed, and I need us to tackle the kitchen together tonight.” Want to try saying it?
Client: (pause) “I’m feeling overwhelmed, and I need us to tackle the kitchen together tonight.”
Therapist: How did it feel?
Client: Strange. But… calmer.
Therapist: Good. Now, your partner might respond in different ways. Let’s role-play a defensive response. I’ll say: “I worked all day too. Why are you always on me?” How do you respond without becoming the prosecutor?
Client: I’d probably snap.
Therapist: Understandable. Let’s try a repair-oriented response: reflect their feeling, then restate your need. Something like: “I hear you’re tired too. I’m not trying to blame you. I need us to share this so I don’t feel alone.” Want to try it?
Client: “I hear you’re tired too. I’m not trying to blame you. I need us to share this so I don’t feel alone.”
Therapist: That was excellent. What do you notice in your body when you say it?
Client: Less heat. Less… fight mode.
Therapist: Exactly. We’re moving from fight mode to connection mode. What do you think your partner might hear differently?
Client: They might not feel attacked. They might actually listen.
Therapist: That’s the idea. Now, there’s another part: making the invisible labor visible. Have you two ever listed responsibilities and agreed on a plan?
Client: Not really. We just argue when something isn’t done.
Therapist: So the system is reactive instead of planned. A neutral “household meeting” could reduce arguments. How does that sound?
Client: I like that. But I’m worried it’ll become a fight.
Therapist: We can structure it. Keep it short—15 minutes. One goal: “What needs to happen this week, and who owns what?” Not “who’s wrong.” Would that be possible?
Client: Maybe.
Therapist: If you tried it, what would be the first step?
Client: Ask them when they have energy to talk. Like, not in the middle of stress.
Therapist: Great. Timing matters. You could say: “Can we pick a time this weekend to plan the week so we don’t keep fighting about chores?” That frames it as preventing fights.
Client: That sounds fair.
Therapist: You also mentioned you bring up the last month’s mistakes. That’s a common pattern called “kitchen sinking”—throwing everything into one argument. What could help you stop when you notice that happening?
Client: I could pause and say, “I’m doing the thing again.”
Therapist: Yes—naming it. A simple phrase like: “I’m overwhelmed and I’m starting to list everything. Let me reset.” That is a powerful repair in real time.
Client: I’ve never done that.
Therapist: It might feel awkward at first, but it signals accountability and keeps the conversation safer. Let’s create a short “pause routine.” When you feel the urge to list everything: you stop, take one breath, and say a reset line. What reset line would sound like you?
Client: “I’m spiraling. I need a second.”
Therapist: Perfect. “I’m spiraling. I need a second.” Then you come back to the one issue at hand.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: How is your sleep and stress level generally?
Client: Sleep is okay-ish. Stress is high. I think I’m carrying resentment.
Therapist: Resentment is a signal that a need has been unmet repeatedly. Our work is to communicate the need clearly and create agreements that reduce the burden. Any concerns about safety—any thoughts of harming yourself or anyone else?
Client: No.
Therapist: Thank you. Let’s summarize homework: (1) Practice a soft start: “I’m overwhelmed and I need us to tackle this together.” (2) Use the reset phrase when you notice kitchen sinking: “I’m spiraling, I need a second.” (3) Ask for a 15-minute household planning meeting this weekend, focused on responsibilities and ownership. How does that feel?
Client: It feels… hopeful. And also scary.
Therapist: Both can be true. Hopeful because there’s a path, scary because it’s new. We’ll review how it went next time.
Client: Okay. I can do that.
