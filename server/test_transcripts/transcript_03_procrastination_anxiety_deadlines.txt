THERAPIST–PATIENT TRANSCRIPT (Sample 3)
Session Theme: Procrastination, anxiety, perfectionism, realistic planning
Format: Plain text dialogue (approx. 15–20 minutes)

Therapist: Hi. What feels most important to talk about today?
Client: I keep procrastinating. I have a deadline coming up, and I can’t start. I’m just… stuck.
Therapist: You want to start, and something blocks you.
Client: Yeah. I’ll open my laptop, stare at the task, and suddenly I’m cleaning my room or scrolling. Anything but the thing.
Therapist: When you’re staring at the task, what thoughts show up?
Client: “This is going to be hard.” “I’m behind.” “If I start, I’ll realize I’m not good enough.”
Therapist: So starting feels like risking proof that you’re not good enough.
Client: Exactly. If I don’t start, I can pretend I could do it if I wanted to.
Therapist: That makes a lot of sense psychologically. Avoidance protects you from the discomfort of that risk. But it also increases pressure.
Client: Yeah, and then I hate myself for avoiding.
Therapist: There’s a self-criticism loop on top of the avoidance.
Client: Totally.
Therapist: Let’s identify the task. What is it specifically?
Client: A presentation for work. I have to propose a new plan. It’s due next week.
Therapist: So it’s important and visible—people will see it.
Client: Yes. And that makes it worse.
Therapist: If you imagine submitting it, what are you afraid people will think?
Client: That it’s sloppy. That I didn’t think it through. That I’m… incompetent.
Therapist: And if they thought that, what would that mean to you?
Client: That I don’t belong there.
Therapist: That’s a big fear: “I don’t belong.” That sounds like imposter feelings.
Client: Yeah. I always feel like I’m one mistake away from being exposed.
Therapist: Many people experience that. The question is: how do we support you to act even with that fear present? Because waiting until fear disappears often keeps you stuck.
Client: True.
Therapist: Let’s look at your current strategy: you try to start by aiming for a good version right away. Does that fit?
Client: Yes. I want the first slide to be perfect.
Therapist: And perfection becomes the barrier. What if we aimed for a “bad first draft” on purpose?
Client: (laughs) That sounds awful.
Therapist: Exactly—because it challenges the perfectionism. But it’s also freeing. A bad draft is easy to improve. No draft is impossible to improve.
Client: That’s true.
Therapist: Let’s create a tiny entry point: What is the smallest possible step you could take that counts as starting?
Client: Open the file?
Therapist: Great. And after opening the file, what’s the next smallest step?
Client: Write the title and maybe bullet points. Even if they’re messy.
Therapist: Yes. We’re lowering the threshold. Now, when you procrastinate, do you notice any body sensations?
Client: My stomach drops. Like dread.
Therapist: Dread. Often dread is the body’s signal of threat—social threat, performance threat. We can respond with grounding instead of avoidance. Would you try a quick grounding exercise?
Client: Sure.
Therapist: Put both feet on the floor. Notice the chair supporting you. Take a slow breath out. Now name five things you see.
Client: The window. A mug. My phone. A plant. The lamp.
Therapist: Great. Four things you can feel physically.
Client: My feet on the floor. My hands on my jeans. The chair. Air on my face.
Therapist: Good. Three things you can hear.
Client: The fan. Distant traffic. My keyboard.
Therapist: Two things you can smell.
Client: Coffee. Maybe… detergent.
Therapist: One thing you can taste.
Client: Mint gum.
Therapist: Nice. How’s the dread now, 0–10?
Client: It was a 7. Now it’s like a 4.
Therapist: Great. Grounding reduces arousal. It doesn’t eliminate the task, but it makes it more tolerable to start. Now let’s talk time. When are you most likely to do focused work?
Client: Morning. If I don’t check messages.
Therapist: So morning is your best window. What time tomorrow morning could you commit to a “bad draft session”?
Client: 9:30 to 10:15.
Therapist: That’s 45 minutes. Perfect. What will you do in that session?
Client: Open the file, dump bullet points, maybe sketch slide headings. No formatting.
Therapist: Exactly. And the rule: you are not allowed to judge quality during that window. Only generate. Evaluation comes later.
Client: That would help.
Therapist: What might get in the way?
Client: I’ll pick up my phone. Or I’ll check Slack.
Therapist: Good to anticipate. Can we design “friction” for distractions?
Client: Put my phone in another room. And maybe set “Do Not Disturb.”
Therapist: Great. And if the “I don’t belong” thought shows up, what could you say back?
Client: “This is just a thought.” Or “Belonging isn’t proven by one deck.”
Therapist: I like that. Another option: “My job is to make a draft, not a masterpiece.” Which resonates?
Client: “Make a draft, not a masterpiece.”
Therapist: Excellent. That’s your anchor phrase. Let’s write your homework clearly:
Client: Okay.
Therapist: Homework: Tomorrow 9:30–10:15, do a “bad first draft” session: open file, title, outline headings, dump bullet points. Phone in another room, Do Not Disturb on. If anxiety rises, do the 5–4–3–2–1 grounding for two minutes, then return to the next tiny step. Anchor phrase: “Make a draft, not a masterpiece.”
Client: That’s clear.
Therapist: How are you feeling now?
Client: Less trapped. Like… I can at least do something.
Therapist: That’s the goal: a doable pathway. Any concerns about your safety—any thoughts of harming yourself or others?
Client: No.
Therapist: Thank you. Let’s check in next session on what you learned from the experiment.
