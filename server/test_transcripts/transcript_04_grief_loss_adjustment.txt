THERAPIST–PATIENT TRANSCRIPT (Sample 4)
Session Theme: Grief, adjustment, coping, meaning
Format: Plain text dialogue (approx. 20–30 minutes)

Therapist: Hi. I’m glad you made it in today. What would you like support with?
Client: I’ve been… really sad. My grandmother passed away two weeks ago, and I thought I was “handling it,” but now it’s hitting me.
Therapist: I’m sorry for your loss. And it makes sense that grief can arrive in waves. What has the last two weeks been like?
Client: At first it was logistics. Family calls, arranging things, being strong. I was busy. Now it’s quiet, and I just… cry randomly.
Therapist: When the noise stops, the feelings have room to show up.
Client: Yeah. And then I feel stupid for crying because she was older and it was expected.
Therapist: You’re judging your grief—like it “shouldn’t” be this big.
Client: Exactly. People keep saying, “She lived a full life.” Like that’s supposed to fix it.
Therapist: Those phrases can feel minimizing, even if people mean well. What did your grandmother mean to you?
Client: She was the one person who made me feel safe. Like I could be messy and still loved.
Therapist: That’s a deep kind of love—unconditional and safe.
Client: Yeah. My parents were… intense. High expectations. My grandmother was calm. She’d make tea and just listen.
Therapist: So losing her is not just losing a person, but losing a source of safety and calm.
Client: Yes. And now I keep reaching for my phone to call her, and then I remember, and it hurts.
Therapist: That moment of remembering can be sharp—like your brain is re-learning reality.
Client: Exactly.
Therapist: Can we spend a moment with what you feel right now as you talk about her?
Client: My throat feels tight. My eyes are burning.
Therapist: Let’s slow down. Take your time. (pause) If you want, put a hand on your chest or throat—wherever feels supportive. What happens when you do that?
Client: (breathes) It’s… soothing. A little.
Therapist: Good. We can make space for the emotion without drowning in it. When you cry, what do you tell yourself?
Client: “Stop it.” “You’re being dramatic.” “Other people have it worse.”
Therapist: Those are harsh messages. If your grandmother were here, what would she say to you in that moment?
Client: She’d say, “Come here.” And she’d hug me. She’d say, “Of course you’re sad. You loved me.”
Therapist: That’s a very compassionate voice. What is it like to imagine her saying that?
Client: It makes me cry more… but in a softer way.
Therapist: Softer grief can feel like love moving through pain. Grief is often the price of love.
Client: That makes sense.
Therapist: What worries you most about grieving?
Client: That I’ll get stuck in it. Like I’ll never feel normal again.
Therapist: That fear is common. Grief doesn’t mean you’ll stay broken; it means you’re adapting. “Normal” might change, but it doesn’t disappear. Have you had moments of relief or okayness in the last two weeks?
Client: A few. Like I laughed at something on TV and then felt guilty.
Therapist: Guilt for laughing—like joy is betrayal.
Client: Exactly. Like if I’m okay, it means I didn’t love her enough.
Therapist: That’s an important belief. What would your grandmother say about you laughing?
Client: She would want me to laugh. She loved when I was happy.
Therapist: So the love might actually invite moments of joy, not forbid them.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: In grief work, we often talk about two tasks: honoring the bond, and rebuilding daily life. Both matter. How have daily routines been—sleep, appetite, work?
Client: Sleep is bad. I wake up at 3 a.m. Appetite is low. Work is… I’m distracted.
Therapist: Those are real impacts. We can bring some gentle structure without forcing you to “move on.” Would you be open to a small routine for sleep support?
Client: Sure.
Therapist: One idea: a short “wind-down” ritual—ten minutes—where you do something that signals care. For example, tea like your grandmother used to make, or writing a few lines to her. Does that resonate?
Client: Tea, definitely. She always made tea.
Therapist: Beautiful. What if your wind-down is: make tea, sit for five minutes, and write one memory or one message to her in a notebook. Not long. Just one.
Client: I like that. It feels… connected.
Therapist: That’s the goal: connection, not erasure. Another way to honor her is a small intentional act in your day that reflects what she valued. What did she value?
Client: Kindness. Patience. Cooking for people.
Therapist: Is there a small act of kindness you could do this week in her honor?
Client: I could cook her lentil soup recipe and share it with my cousin.
Therapist: That’s wonderful—very concrete. How do you feel imagining that?
Client: Sad… but also warm.
Therapist: Warmth is a sign of the bond still being there. Before we close, I want to check: any thoughts about harming yourself or not wanting to be here?
Client: No. I’m just sad. I want to feel better, but I’m not thinking about hurting myself.
Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. Let’s summarize: grief is hitting in waves; you’ve been judging it; we’re going to try bringing in your grandmother’s compassionate voice. Homework: a nightly tea ritual with a short message or memory, and cooking her soup once this week as a kindness act. Also, notice and gently challenge the guilt when you laugh—remind yourself she would want your joy.
Client: That feels good. Like something I can do.
Therapist: Good. We’ll continue next time, and we can also talk about any anniversaries or triggers that come up.
