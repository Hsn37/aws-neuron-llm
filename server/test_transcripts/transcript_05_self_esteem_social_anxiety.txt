THERAPIST–PATIENT TRANSCRIPT (Sample 5)
Session Theme: Self-esteem, social anxiety, confidence-building, self-talk
Format: Plain text dialogue (approx. 20 minutes)

Therapist: Hi. Where would you like to start today?
Client: I have this constant feeling that I’m awkward. Like I don’t know how to talk to people. I avoid social things, and then I feel lonely.
Therapist: You’re caught between wanting connection and fearing social situations.
Client: Exactly. I’ll get invited somewhere and I’ll say no. Then later I’ll scroll and feel bad that I wasn’t there.
Therapist: What’s the fear in the moment when you consider going?
Client: That I’ll say something stupid. Or there will be silence. Or people will see I’m not interesting.
Therapist: So the fear is judgment—being seen as “not enough.”
Client: Yes. And then I start replaying everything I’ve ever said wrong.
Therapist: That replay sounds exhausting. When you imagine being at the event, what do you predict will happen?
Client: I’ll stand there, not know what to say, and people will think, “Why is this person here?”
Therapist: And how certain are you that would happen, 0–100%?
Client: Like… 80%.
Therapist: Pretty high. Let’s see if we can gently reality-test. Has there ever been a time you went to something and it was… okay?
Client: Yeah, sometimes. Like if I’m with one friend. Or if the group is small.
Therapist: So your experience isn’t always a disaster. That suggests the 80% might be anxiety talking.
Client: Maybe.
Therapist: In social anxiety, the mind often overestimates threat and underestimates coping. What do you do when you feel anxious socially?
Client: I try to act normal, but inside I’m panicking. I keep thinking about what I look like.
Therapist: So part of your attention is on self-monitoring: “How do I look? How do I sound?”
Client: Yes.
Therapist: That can make you feel more stuck, because you’re not fully present. A helpful shift is moving attention outward: noticing the room, the other person’s words, and curiosity. Would you be willing to practice a “curiosity” approach?
Client: How?
Therapist: We can create a simple script: two open questions and one reflection. For example: “How do you know the host?” “What’s been keeping you busy lately?” Then reflect: “Oh, that sounds like a lot.” It’s not about being brilliant—it’s about being engaged.
Client: That sounds… easier than trying to be funny.
Therapist: Exactly. Many people think they have to perform. But connection often comes from listening.
Client: I can do listening.
Therapist: Great. Now let’s talk about self-esteem. When you say “I’m awkward,” is that a fact or a feeling?
Client: A feeling. But it feels like a fact.
Therapist: That’s the tricky part. Feelings feel true. What’s a more balanced statement you could try?
Client: “I feel anxious socially, but I can still connect.”
Therapist: That’s excellent. How believable is that, 0–10?
Client: Maybe a 5.
Therapist: A 5 is workable. We’re aiming for believable, not perfect. Now, what’s a small social step you could take this week—something low pressure?
Client: There’s a coworker I like. I could ask them to grab coffee.
Therapist: That’s a great step. What makes it feel low pressure?
Client: It’s just one person. And it’s during the day.
Therapist: Perfect. Let’s plan it. What exactly would you say?
Client: “Hey, do you want to grab coffee sometime this week?”
Therapist: Nice and simple. If they say yes, what would you talk about?
Client: Work stuff. Or… ask how their weekend was.
Therapist: Great. Use the two open questions: “What have you been working on lately?” “What do you like to do outside of work?” Then reflect something you heard.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: What thoughts might show up right before you ask?
Client: “They’ll think I’m weird.” “They’ll say no.”
Therapist: If they say no, what would that mean?
Client: That they don’t like me.
Therapist: That’s one interpretation. Any other possible reasons someone might say no?
Client: Busy schedule. Already have plans. Not into coffee.
Therapist: Exactly. Rejection sensitivity can turn “no” into “I’m unlikeable.” We’ll practice a reframe: “A no is information, not a verdict.” Does that fit?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Let’s also add a calming strategy. When anxiety spikes, where do you feel it?
Client: Heart racing. Hot face.
Therapist: If you notice the hot face, try one slow exhale and relax your shoulders. Then return to the outward focus: what color is the wall, what’s the person saying. That pulls you out of the spotlight.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: I’m also curious: how has sleep been?
Client: Not great. I stay up late thinking.
Therapist: Rumination at night. That can worsen anxiety. A small step could be a “worry dump” earlier in the evening—five minutes writing down worries, then closing the notebook. Would you try that?
Client: I can try.
Therapist: Great. Quick safety check: any thoughts of harming yourself?
Client: No.
Therapist: Thank you. Let’s summarize homework: (1) Ask the coworker for coffee using the simple line. (2) Use the two-question curiosity script and one reflection. (3) If anxiety spikes, slow exhale + shoulders down + focus outward. (4) Do a five-minute worry dump in the evening to reduce nighttime rumination. How does that feel?
Client: It feels structured. Like I have a plan instead of just fear.
Therapist: Exactly. We’ll review what happened next time and adjust based on what you learn.
